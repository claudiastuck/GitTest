// we are going to make the game odds and evens
// the way it works is two people one can be a person and one can be a computer
// put out and number of fingers you want
// if they add up to odd one person wins if they add up to even the other ones win
// kind of similar to rock paper scissors we can do easy stretches and animations like I did on my RPS and we'll get an amazing grade

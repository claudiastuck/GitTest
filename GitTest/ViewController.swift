    // we are going to make the game odds and evens
    // the way it works is two people one can be a person and one can be a computer
    // put out and number of fingers you want
    // if they add up to odd one person wins if they add up to even the other ones win
    // kind of similar to rock paper scissors we can do easy stretches and animations like I did on my RPS and we'll get an amazing grade
    
    // I already made AppIcon, and inserted pictures of each finger possibility to the assets
    // please design on iphone 8 cause then you can run it on something bigger and it works but if you design on xr and then try to run on 8 it doesn't fit at all

       // you can use image literal after you make connections for the images to assign them to each image view in order from 1 to 5 the images are already labled
